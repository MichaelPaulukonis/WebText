The bald bearded bard sings a braided tale of happiness, of woe, of bitter embargoed apples on a barge passing under a bridegroom's bridge by a tepid, vapid moon. His beer is here, and all ale is well, hale, and hearty. This is not my bridge, it is your bridge, your toll bridge, your tool for trolls and travellers. I see you singing, Bradley Bard, I hear you. Your embalmer blames the bridge, his badge is barely adequate for the aqueduct, he ducks his dock responsibilities badly, baldly. Who is the third that walks beside you? How is he known, and how can he see in the dark (if, in fact, he can.) All what? All right, that is okay, he said.";
